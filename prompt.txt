"Implement a structural 8-bit RISC processor (top module risc) with AWIDTH=5 and DWIDTH=8 by instantiating modules with an _inst suffix: a 3-bit phase counter, a controller, a 5-bit counter (PC), an address multiplexor, a 32x8-bit memory named mem_array, an instruction register, an alu, an accumulator register, and a tri-state driver.The architecture uses an 8-bit instruction where the 3-bit opcode is at [7:5] and the 5-bit address is at [4:0]. System timing is driven by a 3-bit phase counter (0-7); the controller must assert signals early enough to allow HLT to stop the processor by the 2nd clock cycle (Phase 1), while other instructions like JMP utilize the full 8-phase duration. Support operations: HLT, SKZ, JMP, LDA, STO, ADD, AND, XOR. Use strict opcode mapping: HLT=0, SKZ=1, ADD=2, AND=3, XOR=4, LDA=5, STO=6, JMP=7. Ensure rst synchronously resets PC and Phase to 0."
