"Complete the implementation of a RISC processor described in sources/risc_processor.v where the top module is named risc. In this module risc is instantiated with suffix _inst the other modules alu, controller, register, counter, multiplexor, driver and memory. For example, the instantiation of the module memory is memory_inst. The RISC processor architecture is defined by two primary local parameters: AWIDTH, set to 5, which establishes a memory address space of 32 words, and DWIDTH, set to 8, defining the system's data word size. These parameters are propagated to sub-modules to configure the 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), accumulator, and instruction register, as well as the 5-bit program counter and address multiplexer. Specifically, the 8-bit instruction is split into a 3-bit opcode and a 5-bit address , while the memory module utilizes both parameters to create a storage array."
