"Implement a structural 8-bit RISC processor (top module risc) with AWIDTH=5 and DWIDTH=8 by instantiating the following modules using an _inst suffix: a 3-bit phase counter , a controller , a 5-bit counter as the PC , an address multiplexor , a 32x8-bit memory , an instruction register , an alu , an accumulator register , and a tri-state driver. The architecture utilizes an 8-bit instruction split into a 3-bit opcode and 5-bit address , driven by an 8-phase control cycle (phases 0-7) to support operations including HLT, SKZ, JMP, LDA, STO, ADD, AND, and XOR. The system must feature a bidirectional data bus , a zero flag feedback loop from the ALU to the controller , and parameterizable widths for all hardware components."
